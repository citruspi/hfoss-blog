Smoke Test

Part of getting started with the XO OLPC's is running through the provided smoke
test[0]. It's split into a couple sections, which have as many as thirty-eight
steps.

Start-up

This was arguably the hardest part of the smoke test. Our battery was already in
the device when we received it, but simply opening it seemed to be a Herculean
task at first. After it opened, it successfully booted into Sugar.

Try out a few Activities

This section had us test that activities worked, the camera captured light, the
microphone captured sound, the speakers produced audio, etc. Everything seemed
to work but there was noticeable lag for some activities.

Image Transferring and Invite

The image transfer test worked but the invitation process took a little time to
get working.

Installing an Activity Bundle

I headed to the wiki page on the Star Chart activity and downloaded the .xo
file. It opened from the home view and ran fine.

Playing an .ogg file in Browse

Using DuckDuckGo, I found some classical music in the public domain online which
was being distributed as an .ogg file. I played it and it was fine.

Transfer Files to USB Stick

I copied a couple files to a USB drive and unmounted it. I remounted it and the
files appeared to persist.
