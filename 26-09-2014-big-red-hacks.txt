Big Red Hacks

rossdylan, decause, and I drove down to Cornell to attend Big Red Hacks. The
drive wasn't too long, only about an hour and a half.

The hackathon was well put together. There was a dedicated room for sleeping, a
ton of volunteers who were very helpful, and a bunch of corporate sponsors.

I also appreciated that they took good care of the vegan and vegetarian
attendees.
