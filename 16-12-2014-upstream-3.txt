Upstream 3

Status: v0.5.0b

This upstream post isn't actually about a bugfix. It's actually about a project
of mine, Spotify Notifications[0], and what it's taught me.

Spotify Notifications isn't a complex application - to put it simply, it
forwards notifications from the NSDistributedNotificationCenter to the default
NSNotificationCenter.

I wrote it because Spotify hadn't implemented the functionality themselves and
other people also wanted it.

I developed the first version over about a day. The same day I published it, it
was featured on TheNextWeb. A couple months later it was nominated for a Webbie
award.

The project now has 135 stars on GitHub from people all around the world who I
haven't met. I've responded to and dealt with 24 issues, of which 7 are still
open. I've also dealt with 12 pull requests, all of which are closed.

And that's just on the GitHub issue tracker. I've also responded to tweets,
emails, etc. asking for issues to be fixed and new features to be implemented.

Spotify Notifications has taught me a lot about open source and about being the
steward of an open source project.
