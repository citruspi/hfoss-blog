Which project did your team choose?

We decided to work on a Reddit client application that will interface with
Reddit’s API to deliver content.

2-liner description of the project?

An application for the XO which will provide a native interface to the Reddit
website and will include extra features like saving articles offline and
managing subreddits, keeping in mind that internet access will not always be
available.

What will each team member's role be?

See table above.

Source Code Repository URL?

How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Address, mail
lists, issue trackers, etc...)

IRC

What are the easy parts?

- Finding and interfacing with API’s
- Extensive manual testing
- Using Python

What are the hard parts?

- Architecting the application
- Finding a robust way to create a GUI
- Time restrictions

How will you overcome both?

We will divide and conquer. Understanding that some points are harder will show
us that we have to work on it with a high priority. Documentation is important
to make sure we don’t step on each others toes.

And finally using awesome tools to help us get the data! (or write them
ourselves).
