YHack

YHack was the furthest hackathon I attended this year, since I didn't attend
Hack the North.

It was hosted at Yale University over Halloween which was really cool. I was
disappointed by the number of attendees who were not in costume, but I can't
really complain since I wasn't in costume myself.

I ended up spending most of my time working on school work but I also worked on
a server for managing SSH keys across multiple servers.
