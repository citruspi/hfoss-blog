Syncthing

For the past couple weeks I've been using Bittorent Sync to sync photos and
configuration files between my laptop, desktop, and various servers.

I've really enjoyed using it but I found another project called Syncthing. It's
a open source sync service which runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, BSD, and Solaris.
It also looks really easy to setup and use, so I'm planning on giving it a try.

If I take a liking to it, perhaps I'll write an iOS client to complement the
Android one.
