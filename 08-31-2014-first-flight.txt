First Flight

IRC

I already had IRC setup - I have a weechat instance running on a server. The
instance is maintined through tmux and whwnver I want to use IRC I just SSH
into the machine and attach to the tmux session.

Blogging

While thinking about my options for a blog I realized that I'm not happy with
the exiting solutions, at least not in this case. They're all too complex.
Therefore I've decided to just use .txt files in a directory with listing
enabled. Updating it is as simple as

ssh citruspi@178.79.143.155
vim /srv/citruspi.io/hfossblog/newpost.txt

GitHub

I already have a GitHub presence at citrupi.

Patch the Course Project

Patching the course is the next thing to do. It should be pretty simple:

git clone https://github.com/decause/hflossk.git
vim scripts/people/2014/fall/citrupi.yaml
git commit
git origin add citruspi git@github.com:citruspi/hflossk
git push citruspi master
