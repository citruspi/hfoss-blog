Brimir

Brimir is a ticket management system for handling support requests via email.
That in itself isn't particularly interesting - there are plenty of ticket
management systems.

The awesome thing about Brimir is that it's open source - you can run it
yourself on your own systems without having to pay tribute to the cloud gods.

The project is written in Ruby and uses Postgres as a backend.
