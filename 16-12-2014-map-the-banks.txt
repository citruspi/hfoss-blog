Map the Banks

I stumbled upon a really cool project yesterday called Map the Banks.

The project enlists the help of programmers to scrape financial websites and
make the data publicly available. They create missions which have different
levels of difficulty. Coders undertake missions by writing bots with the Turbot
framework which scrap the data and upload it. They're then awarded points and
ranked on the leaderboard.
