Hunger Hacks

This weekend I took the train down to Syracuse to attend Hunger Hacks, a
hackathon where attendees work to create solutions related to homelessness or
the hungry.

Unfortunately I had only slept for two hours the night before so I ended up
doing more sleeping than coding.

However, it was one of the best hackathons I've been to. We had guests who
worked with the hungry and homeless and they talked about their experiences and
about what software and tools were needed.

We also go to see an awesome documentary made by one of the guests.
Unfortunately it hasn't been released publicly yet, but I hope it comes out
soon.
