What project did your team choose?

We chose to work on Gratipay.

Two liner description of the project?

Gratipay (formerly Gittip) is a way to give small weekly cash gifts to people 
you love and are inspired by [mosty developers]. Gifts are weekly;public and 
the intention is for people to depend on money received through Gratipay in 
order to pay their bills, and bills are recurring.

What will each team member's role be?

See above.

Source Code Repository URL?

Upstream Mentors:

Name            Email
TBD             TBD

How will you communicate with them?

- IRC Channel (#gratipay on freenode)
- GitHub issues

What are the easy parts?

- Finding communication channels
- Choosing a project
- Writing up a conclusion of the projects health

What are the hard parts?

- Getting involved 
- Running Git-by-a-truck/bus
- Finding/Mining for relevant data regarding the project

How will you overcome both?

We will divide and conquer. Understanding that some points are harder will 
show us that we have to work on it with a high priority. Documentation is 
important to make sure we donâ€™t step on each others toes. Tools like GDoc 
and IRC help keep the work progress visible.

And finally using awesome tools to help us get the data! (or write them ourselves).e
