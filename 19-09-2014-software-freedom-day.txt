Software Freedom Day

I was invited to Hack the North at the University of Waterloo however decause
was hosting the Software Freedom Day hackathon at MAGIC@RIT and I opted to stay
for that.

It was a blast, but not very productive ultimately. I ended up switching between
a couple different projects and I ended up not making a lot of progress in any
of them.

I did get to play around with one of the newest Firefox OS phones and it was
pretty nice and I look forward to seeing how the platform shapes up in the
future.
