Curriculum

For class we were tasked with looking into the similarities and differences
between the 4th grade math curriculum for the states of Massachusetts and New
York.

Both curriculums incorporate the Common Core Standards, leading them to be
extremely similar.

Similarities:

- Operations & Algebraic Thinking
- Numbers & Operations in Base Ten
- Numbers & Operations â€” Fractions
- Measurement & Data
- Geometry

Differences:

- The Massachusetts curriculum expects students to be able to know
  multiplication tables up to 12x12
