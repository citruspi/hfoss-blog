Upstream 1

Status: Merged Upstream

After my not-incredibly-technical bugfix which consisted of adding a license to
a repository, I figured I'd get my hands dirty this time.

A friend of mine, Tim Duffy, had posted a link to ticket system he was writing
called bits. It sounded pretty interesting so I cloned it and got it running.

Before logging in, I found an issue - the field type for the password was set to
'text.' This meant that the password was clear text when being typed in.

I submitted a pull request[0] fixing this error by setting the type to
'password.' You can now rest easy knowing that the Internet is safe.
