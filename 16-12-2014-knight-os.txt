Knight OS

Based on what I saw while in middle school, high school, and college, Texas
Instruments calculators are incredibly popular. In fact, they're so popular that
people have written games, tools, etc. for them.

One of the cooler projects I've seen is KnightOS, an operating system designed
for calculators. Applications for the operating system can be written in
Assembly or C. There's excellent documentation and a reachable community who can
be found on IRC.
