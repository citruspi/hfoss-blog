Last week we were visited by Hudl and Vimeo. Each company took a separate room
in Golisano and then gave a presentation on itself. At first I went to the
Hudl talk but I quickly grew bored and I ended up leaving to go to the Vimeo
talk. It was about as interesting as the Hudl talk but included a few
humerous videos.
