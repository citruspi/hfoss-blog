Status: Merged

Reeling from my incredibly technical pull request fixing an HTML form, I figured
I'd take it easy this time.

After finding rossdylan's fabulous library, I stumbled upon ryansb's tremendous,
a Python wrapper for fabulous. I noticed there was an extra parenthese in the
sample code in the Readme, an error which would have caused users an extra
second or two of frustration, before the error was caught by the interpreter or
their linter.

Well, fear not; I've submitted a pull request removing the extra parenthese[0].
