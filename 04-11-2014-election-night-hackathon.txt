Election Night Hackathon

I attended the annual election night hackathon at RIT this year and it was lots
of fun. It was held in the MAGIC center and all nine projects were on,
projecting real time updates from different campaigns.

Unfortunately, there wasn't any vegan pizza, but hopefully next time.
