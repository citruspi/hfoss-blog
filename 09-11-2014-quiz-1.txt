What are the similarities between Weber's eight principles, and the five 
pillars?

    Weber's eight principles and the five pillars have much in common. The
    eighth principle and the fifth pillar are both about community. In addition,
    the third pillar and the seventh principle are essentially the same thing - 
    release early, release often. 

What are the differences?

    Key differences between the pillars and the principles are that the
    principles cover getting people interested ("Make it interesting and 
    make sure it happens") whereas the pillars make the assumption that the
    project already has followers who are motivated to get involved. In addition,
    the principles don't cover meritocracy.
