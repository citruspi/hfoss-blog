Meetup 3

On November 18th our class headed to RocPy for the monthly meetup.

msoucy, ross, and threebean presented lighnting talks.

For the module of the month, threebean presented itertools.

The primary talk for the meetup concerned using other languages with Python. The
talk focused on using C in Python programs and Python in C programs but it took
a brief look at other languages like Objective-C.

Unfortunately the talk was very dry and unexciting.
